        Power-building is a combination of powerlifting and bodybuilding. it is essentially bodybuilding
        except done with heavy lifting. The best example of a power-builder is the 8 time consecutive Mr Olympia
        champion, Ronnie Coleman. He is regarded as the greatest bodybuilder of all time. However while his physique
        and sizing was monstrous, they were rivalled by the weight he pushed. This is the reason he is my inspiration.<br><br>

    <h4>
        My journey in Power-building
    </h4>
    <p id="parTwo" >
        I began my journey in power-building about 2 years ago and have achieved great feats in both the strength and
        physique areas of the sport. I enjoy this sport because of both the heavy weight that can be pushed as well as 
        the various health benefits that come with the sport. As a bonus there is also the fact that im always ready 
        for summer. There are ups and downs in this sport and often times where theres no motivation to keep going
        but the continous progress and love for the sport is what has kept me going.<br><br>

    <h4>
        The bench, squat and deadlift
    </h4>
    <p>
        These 3 attributes are the only lifts in powerlifting and form a big part of any good workout schedule. This 
        is because they are all <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+compound+lift&sxsrf=ALeKk03aZIal2yJdFdkScPwbqu8I3ntWwg%3A1617714290658&ei=clxsYMrmJ4eDhbIP89KEqAY&oq=&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYATIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJ1AAWABg-cgBaAFwAngAgAHXAogB1wKSAQMzLTGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz"

        Bench

            The bench is always one of everyones favourite excercises and is the most commonly used compound
            lifts. It mainly activates the chest however it also uses the anterior deltoid and triceps to lift
            the weight. My current personal best in the bench press is 90 kgs, this is 10 kgs off my goal. The 
            bench is used to achieve an overall bigger chest and can be done with different forms. This is my 
            favourite lift to do and i strive to do it in a chest day at least 2 days per week. <br><br>

        While the squat is not everyones favourite and is often skipped, along with the rest of leg day, it is 
        one of the most important lifts to getting bigger legs. However doing a squat correctly is also of high importance
        and should always be done either in a "parallel" manner. A squat activates the entirety of the lower body as well
        as the lower back muscle. Currently i have a personal record of 160 kg.<br><br>

    <p id="parFive" >
        The deadlift is known as the king of compounds, this is due to the fact it activates every muscle in your 
        body when performed. It is often the compound lift done with the most weight. On average the weight is double 
        ones own bodyweight. This is the lift i am proudest of and can currently deadlift 210 kgs. While this weight is fun
        it is one of the more dangerous forms of lifts as it can cause both a hernia or lower back issues.<br><br>
