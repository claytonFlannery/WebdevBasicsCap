                gaming
            </h4>
            <p>
                Gaming is a hobby that is a lot of fun for me while being something intense and competitive.
                I mainly play COD but have also played a few of the royale games for tournament purposes.
                Warzone was also a lot of fun to play when it came out and it was fun to compete in duos 
                to see which team could get the most kills in the tournament. My two favourite games are :
                <span class="one">Call of Duty</span>   and   <span class="one">Ghost of Tsushima</span>
            </p>

                Music is a hobby not only because im almost always listening to it but because i create music as well.
                I started off making beats on my laptop a few years ago and enjoyed that for awhile until i started to 
                listen to eminem. There is good reason as to why he is one of the five kings of rap and this is because
                of his ability in lyricism. This ability set him aside from other rappers in the game because not only
                does he rhyme, tell a story and land bars perfectly to a beat but he can win rap battles and is quick 
                on his feet with words. As marshall says <em> "if you had one shot, one oppurtunity to sieze everything you ever
                wanted, in one moment, would you capture it?"</em> and while this is a somewhat  obscure quote to have it 
                is a great source of motivation to me because its a constant reminder to succeed.

            <p>
                While netflix probably isnt a good hobby to have its what i like to watch series on 
                in my free time. i usually watch cartoon series such as Bojack horseman or south park.
